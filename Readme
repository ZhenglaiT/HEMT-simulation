to do:complete the simulation of HEMT using DEVSIM

Detail:
Most physical models or mathematical formulas are coming from the Silvaco guide book, like the Schottky contacts, polarization etc.
Most material dependent physical parameters is calculated in the .mlx file. For their calculation methods, please refer to Silvaco guide or articles. 
The  thermionic emission model also refer to the Charon guide book, its description on the direction of current density is complete. So I can use the band gap to judge the sign of each terms.
For the calculation of equilibrium carrier concentration, I derived it based on its equilibrium definition (Φn=Φp=V_applied) and the relationship of the surface potential on the Schottky contact. The specific details are in "calculation of carrier_eq.doc"
I change the DD model to consider the influence of band structure. It is described in Silvao guide book, in part 6.2.1.
By defining a equivalent potential, I think it can use same discrete form.


Code:
The code mainly comes from the DEVSIM, I have done some changes in original script.
